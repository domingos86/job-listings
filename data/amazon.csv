The best optimization R&D role- period.<br/><br/>The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandize from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.<br/><br/>Modeling and Optimization team is responsible for building network optimization models and analytic tools that improve the economics of the North American, European, and Asian fulfillment networks as Amazon increases the speed and decreases the cost to deliver product to customers.

Each FC holds millions of items that can be ordered in any combination, challenging Amazon to get the items ordered by a customer into a single box and delivered to the customer on time. The pick, pack, and ship process is controlled by software algorithms that automate operations decisions to optimize the use of constrained resources to minimize the operational cost while meeting all deadlines; algorithms also guide the movement of people within the fulfillment center to balance the flow of work across the processes. In addition, optimization algorithms play a pivotal role in the design of the processes and equipment within the fulfillment centers. These problems lead to a plethora of combinatorial and dynamic optimization problems to both improve our existing processes and integrate new technologies (e.g., robotics, computer vision, etc.). Better algorithms will enable us to reduce variable costs and reduce capital investments.<br/><br/>The ideal candidate will have good communication skills with both technical and business people with ability to speak at a level appropriate for the audience.<br/><br/>","[{""elements"": [""- Ph.D. in Operations Research, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics or a related field.<br/>- Experience writing scripts (Perl, Python, Ruby, Groovy) to manipulate data and developing software in traditional programming languages (C++, Java).<br/>- Experience designing simulation and optimization models in for business decisions (e.g., staff/job scheduling, network routing, facility location) and/or feedback and model predictive control.<br/>- Experience in designing/implementing online algorithms and approximation schemes for hard optimization problems addressing particular business needs (e.g. dynamic resource allocation problems for fulfillment center processes).<br/>- Experience designing/implementing machine learning algorithms tailored to particular business needs and tested on large datasets.<br/>- Published at least 2 refereed academic papers in at least two areas (mathematical optimization and theoretical computer science, specifically linear programming, combinatorial optimization, integer programming, network flows, dynamic programming, approximation/online algorithms and machine learning,).""], ""type"": ""Basic Qualifications""}, {""elements"": [""Ph.D and at least 2-3 years work experience.<br/>- Experience in designing/implementing online algorithms and approximation schemes for hard optimization problems (e.g. dynamic resource allocation problems for fulfillment center processes).<br/>- Experience designing/implementing machine learning algorithms tailored to particular business needs and tested on large datasets.<br/>- The ability to implement models and tools through the use of high-level modeling languages (e.g. AMPL, Mosel, R, Matlab, Julia)<br/>- Practical experience developing decision support tools based on optimization and simulation technology (LP, MIP, NLP, JavaSim) for planning and execution support (e.g., staff/job scheduling, network routing, facility location).<br/><br/>Amazon is an Equal Opportunity-Affirmative Action Employer \u2013 Minority / Female / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>""], ""type"": ""Preferred Qualifications""}]"

Payments on the internet today look largely like they did fifteen years ago, in contrast to every other part of the web. At Amazon we have figured out how to build a massively-scalable payment eco-system. Now we want to bring it to the world and launch the next set of big innovations in the industry! Amazon Payments' vision is that every Amazon customer will pay with Amazon Payments every time and every place s/he transacts anywhere online. You will play a leading role in building the only 1 billion plus on-boarding, account management, and monitoring platform in the world. Our product will seamlessly recognize a billion customers across online and offline channels, mobile, and other connected devices (Omni-channel) recognize their needs, tailor Amazon services to their preferences, and identify patterns of customer behavior to reward and rebuke. To succeed, we will need to identify hundreds of thousands of typologies/behavioral patterns for several billions of customers by mining data collected at point of sales, and every device they used to consume Amazon services. You will be working with data from 1 out of 7 people in the world, 1 out of 3 people on the internet, today. To make this happen, suspicious activity detection technology needs to be re-defined and scaled to a whole other dimension, allowing us to separate the good from the evil effectively, which is where you come into the picture!<br/><br/>Machine learning and data science present a powerful solution to the current problems facing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs. As a machine learning scientist, you will leverage your machine learning and advanced data science skills to identify, detect, and prevent Anti-Money Laundering modus operandi. This includes building behavior-centric models for seller and buyer activity, classifying transaction activity of customers with similar traits (business type, geographic location, age, etc.), clustering customers with similar transactions behavior, and identifying outliers from the crowd. You will also build systems that leverage unique storage systems such as graph database technologies, and build a sophisticated rules management platform for our compliance and risk evaluations.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we make the world a better place by preventing unlawful activity on our platform, and making it easier for normal sellers and buyers to safely and seamlessly conduct their business. Join us in building platforms and products to protect Amazon and its customers by keeping unlawful activity off Amazon, and then scale your solutions to the exponential growth of Amazon.

Combine this with the opportunity to be a key research leader and individual contributor building innovative transportation capabilities for the world’s most customer centric company and what do you get? The best optimization R&D role. Period.<br/><br/>The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors/third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandize from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers. This involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, which presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.<br/><br/>The Last Mile Strategic Planning team is a global team that works with operations and tech teams in each of our markets to decide the long-term strategy of our Global Last Mile operations. We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team, focusing on transportation network modeling and design. This individual will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, he/she will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives.<br/><br/>Some of the key job responsibilities include:<br/>· Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the transportation network including network optimization, process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives.

We serve and respond to hundreds of billions of requests annually, and have ambitions to grow that number several orders of magnitude, while maintaining response latencies in the milliseconds and meeting strict SLA requirements. We delight in data, and are constantly trying to enrich our models and make more informed decisions using every bit and byte we have. Our current systems serve our current needs, but we are growing a new business within Amazon.com, and are looking for the sort of hands on leaders and developers who can design and build the systems that will take us into the future.<br/><br/>About you:<br/>You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.<br/><br/>About us together:<br/>We're going to change the way that the advertising world measures, plans, and buys. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.<br/><br/>The ideal developer for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.<br/><br/>Some problem spaces we'll be working on:<br/><br/>AD PLATFORM - accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. You may specialize in one area or another, but will need to consider the problem holistically. Today, we are a global operation with infrastructure in North America, Europe and Asia and we are looking to enter India and Brazil. Our platform is hosted in AWS and we serve ads for Mobile (mobile web, Amazon mobile APPs and 3rd Party Mobile Apps) and Desktop Web (both on Amazon owned and operated properties as well as third party sites via Ad Exchanges and Direct relationships). we are looking to continue to rearchitect the platform this year to better enable us to handle the demands of scaling the business enabling both enterprise managed- and self-service growth in addition to small business self-service growth.<br/><br/>OPTIMIZATION - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. Couple that with an almost overwhelming amount of real-time data and the need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict performance against our customers' goals. You’ll need to be both an engineer and scientist – you’ll build the platforms to test and measure your hypotheses, iterate on your designs, and find innovative signals and solutions that fundamentally shift the effectiveness of our systems.<br/><br/>EXPERIMENTATION - advertisers spend a lot of money to develop their ads, and we want to ensure that those ads will drive the best performance possible. To do so, we need to develop the data, analysis and technical frameworks to enable incredibly precise, highly impactful decisions that directly impact the ad performance. Furthermore, the experimentation framework needs to provide the ability for our internal partners to configure and execute experiments on our algorithms and infrastructure with sufficiently low friction to encourage further experimentation.<br/><br/>Questions?:<br/>You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements?

While the screening services have to cater to Amazon’s scale and business needs as any other service, it is also bound to high level of accuracy and precision. What makes this space more challenging and interesting is the balance that needs to be maintained with high degree of accuracy and growing false positive alerts. This is an excellent opportunity to leverage continuous learning from manual decisions for producing ongoing enhanced precision.

To do so, we need to develop the data, analysis and technical frameworks to enable incredibly precise, highly impactful decisions that directly impact the ad performance.

Echo connects to Alexa, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more—instantly. It's hands-free, and always on. All you have to do is ask.<br/><br/>To achieve this, we blend of a variety of disciplines (such as NLP, data mining, machine learning, big data, semantic web, graph stores, cloud computing) in an effort to understand our customers and the things they're excited about. To complement our complex algorithms and extensive data analyses, we create elevated and inspirational mobile and web features across the entire Echo system. We use artificial intelligence, data mining and usability studies to develop new features, and we test them through hundreds of R & D experiments a year. We want to make it easy for you to search for your favorite products, discover new brands you’d like, play your favorite songs or even replenish your fridge - and much, much more!! We are also incredibly intent on solving some of the most complex computing problems to be found in industry and academia, and we get to test our solutions in the real world every day. And most importantly, we relentlessly ask: ""What haven't we though of yet?""<br/><br/>On a day-to-day basis, you will lead an organization of close-knit engineers that are incredibly technical, agile, data driven, and highly collaborative. You'll find yourself partnering across organizations with world-class technical leaders, Engineers, Research Scientists and Data Analysts, PhDs and industry veterans who have expertise in a wide range of disciplines. You’ll help analyze customer behavior, propose innovative ideas and solutions, implement big things, and then measure the results. Engineers on our team love to break things to see how they work, iterate and fail fast, improve on what works, discard what doesn't, and learn from both. And we love to have fun! We gather often for social events, and we regularly get out of the office (rain or shine) to discover new things outside of work.<br/><br/>If you're as passionate as we are about making Alexa and Echo increasingly awesome for our customers all around the world, we'd love to chat with you! We're seeking highly talented, driven and motivated technical leaders with big ideas, who are also obsessed with finding new, intuitive, and engaging ways to interact with our customers.
